                I am from the wonderful furniture <br>
                <br>From ranger scout spray and coal <br>
                <br>I am from the natural kitchen on the side of my house, fresh, full of air <br>
                <br>I am from the abandon pinky rose apple <br>
                <br>The sourest smoothest mango whose long gone limbs I remember as if they were my own.<br>
                <br>I’m from Chinese new year, Khmer new year and an empathetic person <br>
                <br>From my mom and my dad <br>
                <br>I’m from waking up in the early morning and sweeping the floor every day <br>
                <br>I’m from the ability to understand lesson faster and at the same time forget it faster and <br>
                <br>from who afraid teachers and rules the most. <br>
                <br>I’m from going to pagoda when Pchum Ben festival <br>
                <br>Accompany by many food and snacks <br>
                <br>And listen to the monk pray but not much. <br>
                <br>I’m from Kampot and the slender river where there are many boats <br>
                <br>Fried shrimp with dried red bell pepper and Steam Crabs <br>
                <br>From my great grandfather who I never met before in my life <br>
                <br>who died before I was born since Khmer Rouge and left my great grandma alone <br>
                <br>The first picture necklace of them I’ve ever seen before <br>
                <br>   On my grandma’s neck that she’s wearing every day and will never forget about this <br>
                memento. <br>

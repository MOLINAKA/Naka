            Hello, all of the wonderful people! Welcome to my blog! My name is Molinaka known as Naka. I’m 13 years old. 
            I was born in Kampot province, in a community which is an area surrounded by many schools. I love playing every sport, but most 
            likely to be Handball, basketball, and frisbee.  I am a person who has a passion for Economic, Geography, Reading and especially, math.
            The people surrounding me includes my friends, always describe me as a tender person and very supportive. The core value that I appreciate
            most and always display in myself is “ Integrity ”. 
            
            Living and studying in Liger is very different from my past life. Liger provides me an education and a warm house which I feel like 
            my second family.  They also provide many supplies for daily life uses and many educational and entertainment opportunities. 
            Moreover, they teach me how to live independently, have my own responsibility, and many more life skills. Since I study at my hometown, 
            government school, I feel like I’m a blind person who had only learned in school and never knew what was happening in the society and 
            outside the world. But after I came to Liger, I got introduced to many more subjects and more about technology and I seem to know more 
            and learn more not only in school but also exploring outside the city and see other people’s lives. In addition, I got the opportunities 
            to join many social events which I haven’t only learned from the events but also from different people and learn from them and their experiences.
               
            Currently, I still can’t identify what my passion for the future is yet. However, in the future, I would like to become a change agent for 
            my community, society and make a brighter future for Cambodia.</p>

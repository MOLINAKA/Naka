                    In Khmer, my full name, <i>“Lim Molinaka”</i>, doesn’t mean anything and it
                    seems as simple as the blue sky, however, the middle part of my name,
                    <i>“Moli”</i> has its meaning as special as the moon. It means fortune and
                    talented. My dad is the one that put this name for me. Since I was about
                    years old, my name was just <i>“Lim Moli”</i>, but because I had a lot of illness, so
                    my dad think that there’s something wrong with this name, so he added
                    <i>“Naka”</i> to that name. Compare my current name to my past name, I would
                    love to have the current name instead and there are a few reasons to this,
                    as you read more, you will find out why. <br>
                    <br>
                    I feel so lucky and satisfied to have this current name because it’s
                    simple, uncomplicated to call and spell, not too short or not too long, and as
                    you know that I don’t like to have the same name with anyone, so since i
                    was born until now, I’ve never seen people who have the same name as me
                    because it’s so rare. If there is people that have this name as well, I really
                    want to know what are they like, are they the same me or how’re they
                    different from me or what is their special part as we have the same name.
                    Moreover, In my family, there is no one that have the name as long as me,
                    and i think my name is better than my sister and my brother because there
                    are many people that have the same name as them, except me.<br>
                    <br>
                    At last, I think this name define me really well and I would not want to
                    have another name instead of this, also i don’t know what’s other name to
                    put instead this because I just don’t want to have the same name
                    as anyone else.<br>
